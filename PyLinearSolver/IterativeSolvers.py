The method uses short recurrences and therefore has fixed memory costs and fixed computational costs per iteration.

    The function is a wrapper for the julia implementation of Chebyshev Iteration solver in IterativeSolver.jl package.
    Chebyshev iteration solves the problem :math:`Ax=b` approximately for :math:`x` where :math:`A` is a symmetric, definite linear operator and b the right-hand side vector. \
    The methods assumes the interval :math:`[λmin,λmax]` containing all eigenvalues of :math:`A` is known, so that :math:`x` can be iteratively constructed via a Chebyshev polynomial with zeros in this interval. \
    This polynomial ultimately acts as a filter that removes components in the direction of the eigenvectors from the initial residual.
    The main advantage with respect to Conjugate Gradients is that BLAS1 operations such as inner products are avoided.

Stationary Methods
==================
    Stationary methods are typically used as smoothers in multigrid methods, where only very few iterations are applied to get \
    rid of high-frequency components in the error. The implementations of stationary methods have this goal in mind, which means \
    there is no other stopping criterion besides the maximum number of iterations.
